# AI-Based Green Packaging Design and Public Health Service Optimization

## Introduction
This repository houses the implementation of an innovative framework designed to enhance green packaging design and optimize public health services in the context of environmental degradation. By integrating EEG analysis with public health modeling, this project aims to understand and improve the interplay between packaging design, consumer cognition, and health outcomes.

## Project Overview
Green packaging design is pivotal in sustainable development, influencing consumer behavior, environmental health, and overall public welfare. Traditional packaging methods often fail to consider the intricate relationship between material properties, human cognition, and health outcomes, thereby limiting their effectiveness in addressing concurrent environmental and public health challenges.

This study introduces a new framework that leverages:
- **Integrated Multi-Objective Packaging Model (IMOPM)**: Optimizes material selection, structural functionality, and sustainability performance.
- **Adaptive Sustainable Packaging Strategy (ASPS)**: Utilizes lifecycle assessment, adaptive material technologies, and real-time environmental feedback to continually refine packaging designs.

## Methodology
The project employs computational techniques to merge EEG analysis with sophisticated modeling of public health impacts. Here's what the methodology section covers:
- **Experimental Setup**: Description of the EEG setup and data collection processes.
- **Model Development**: Steps in the development of IMOPM and ASPS, including algorithms and computational models used.
- **Validation**: Approach for experimental validation highlighting the frameworkâ€™s effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

## Results
Initial results indicate significant enhancements in cognitive engagement, reduced pollutant exposure, and bolstered public health resilience. Further details and specific findings are documented within.

## Installation
